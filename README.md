## Setup

Prerequisites: [Java][3] and [Leiningen][4].

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig:dev

and open your browser at [localhost:9500][2].  This will auto compile
and send all changes to the browser without the need to reload.  After
the compilation process is complete, you will get a Browser Connected
REPL.  An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To create a production build run:

    lein fig:prod
